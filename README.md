# Instrument-Simulation
FPGA Cyclone 2 final project coding
Goal was to upload a code to a DE2 board that would simulate like an instrument.
After pressing the corresponding key button, the selected button would appear on the 7-bit display.
Also another feature was to add a "demo" button whe pressed would play a simple pattern
This pattern would be updated by an external clock that the user would press.
